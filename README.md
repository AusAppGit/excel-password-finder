# excel-password-finder
Based on the repository: https://github.com/pferrarezi/office_pass_finder from: [pferrarezi](https://github.com/pferrarezi) 
This is a slightly more robust version, first checking if the file is encrypted at all, then
offering to check for passwords which are digits only, alphas only, then any character.
It's a brute force concept and will take a while if the original password was more than
a few characters long.
